A patcher for de blob 2 (DS)

### To Start
Clone or download the repository.
#### On Windows
[Get RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/), and run it to install Ruby. After installing Ruby you can open the .rb file with the Ruby interpreter (or start the command prompt with Ruby, navigate to the db2-ds-patcher folder, and execute `ruby patcher.rb`). When using the Ruby interpreter, if the program closes suddenly you have encountered an error. Errors are only logged when using the command prompt with Ruby.

### To Use
